        "q8": "Are there any side effects of lymphatic drainage massage?",
        "a8": "Minor side effects like fatigue or mild flu-like symptoms may occur as the body processes mobilized toxins. These can be alleviated by staying hydrated after the massage.",

        "q13": "What is the lymphatic system?",
        "a13": "The lymphatic system is a crucial part of the body's immune and circulatory systems, comprising a network of lymph nodes, vessels, and channels that transport lymph – a fluid containing white blood cells and waste products – throughout the body.

Avoiding heavy foods, alcohol, and caffeine for a few hours after the massage can further optimize the benefits of the treatment."
